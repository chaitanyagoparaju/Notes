Guided Access helps you to stay focused on a task while using your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. It temporarily limits the device to a single app and lets us control which app features are available. 
Guided Access helps us achieve the following:
- Temporarily restrict your iOS device to a single app
- Disable areas of the screen that aren’t relevant to a task, or areas where an accidental gesture might cause a distraction
- Disable the hardware buttons

Guided Access temporarily locks down your iPhone to one app. Guided access also disables the hardware buttons (the “Home” button) so that you can’t return to the Home screen. 

To enable/disable guided access, go to Settings, General, Accessibility, and select Guided Access. Flip the switch and tap Set Passcode to create a four-digit passcode. 
If you want to allow someone - a child perhaps - to use a specific app on your iPad, but you don't want them to access the photos and email, you can lock your iPad to a single app. 

Using Guided Access is a three-step process:

Enable Guided Access on your phone.
Start a Guided Access session when needed with a triple-click.
End the Guided Access session with a triple-click and passcode or Touch ID to return to normal device usage.
